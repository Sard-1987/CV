            <h2>PROFILE</h2>
            <P>I am a Loreto College Coleraine student. I am interested in getting into law, <br>
                specifically a lawyer. I am preparing for my grade five guitar and singing. I <br>
                have helped my mom out with community work ever since I have been able. <br>
                This has built my people and leadership skills. I am also a member of the <br>
                First Porstewart Scouts who I have done badge work with. This has <br>
                increased my drive to achieve objectives</P>
